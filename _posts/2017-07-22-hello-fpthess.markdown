Welcome to _Functional Programming Thessaloniki User Group_. _FPThess_ is the evolution
of _Thessaloniki Clojure Meetup_. The reason of this transition is to be able to host
a wider variety of languages and technologies and to, hopefuly, find more people to be involved.

_FPThess_ events will take place at [lambdaspace] starting at September 2017.
The goal is to have presentations and workshops, with at least one event a month.
To be informed about news and events, check the [RSS feed][feed.xml],

If you want to present something or just say hello, please [contact] me.

Best regards,

Kostas
